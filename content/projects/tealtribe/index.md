The "Tealtribe" is a group of people who follow the spiritual and psychology teachings of Teal Swan.
This community consists of a lot of people who find one another online.
A lot of community people (or the so called "Teal Tribers") find help and support in one another.
The communities goal is to end sepperation within themselves and end sepperation and loneliness within the world.

I created a [website](https://tealtri.be) with various services for this community and will tell you all the details about tools and methods used below.

## The project
Since this is a community that deals with a lot of loneliness and stuckness and seperation I wanted to make it easier for the members to find one another in real live.
I wanted to create a tool that would make it easier for them to see who is in their neighborhood.
So I wanted an application where people could add their closest city location along with their socials and I wanted an intergrated chat with whom community members could talk to one another with.
